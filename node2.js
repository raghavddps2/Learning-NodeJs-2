//Another cool thing we can do with node is that it can tell as as to where we are (Basicallly tthe directory and the file name)
console.log(__dirname);
//This is again on the global object

//Now if we take it as filename, we are gonna get the complete file name as well along with the directory.
console.log(__filename);

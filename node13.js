//In this tutorial series, we are gonna create a serverin nodeJS.

/*
    We have a client and a server. A client basically gives a request to the server, and a response is given by the server to the client.
    A proptocol is baiscallly a set of communication rule which two sides have to agree to agree on when they communicate.


    The client and the server agree with a particular rule known as a rule, thats a protocol.

    We know that each computer or server can be identified by its own unique or IP address.
    So, if a client wants to make a request to the server, then it will have to connect to the IP address. 

    So, it is gonna open up what is known as the socket for two computers(Basically a channel along which information can be sent.)
    and the information that is sent, is sent by different protocols, (Like HTTP or FTP). So, FTP is for file transfer protocol, and //#endregionHTTP is always used for a webpahge

    So, the way the information goes from the server to the client is via a protocol called TCP (Transmission control Protocol)
    It divides the data into small packets and they are called as sockets.

    Next, we have soemthong called as Ports. NodeJs sends it through a particular post number through an IP addess.
    That is how we read our request using NodeJs, the port for ex 3000 will be listening to us.
